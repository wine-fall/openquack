# Roadmap

Atomic tasks — every item cites a SPEC and maps to a PR. Agent contributors should claim a task by opening a draft PR; see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## Status

- 🟡 **in progress** — draft PR or open issue
- 🔵 **spec** — `docs/SPECS/<id>.md` exists; ready to claim
- ⚪ **idea** — not specced yet
- 🟢 **done** — merged
